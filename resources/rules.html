            Objectives:
            <ul class="rules-item">
                <li>White: escape with the King via moving to one of the corner fields.</li>
                <li>Black: capture the King by surrounding him on all four sides with black pawns.</li>

            Movement:
            <ul class="rules-item">
                <li>Black moves first, then players take turns - passing is not allowed.</li>
                <li>All pieces can move on straight lines and are blocked by other pieces.</li>
                <li>The corner and center tiles are restricted and can only be entered by the King</li>

            Capturing:
            <ul class="rules-item">
                <li>A piece is captured when it ends up neighboring two hostile pieces horizontally or vertically.</li>
                <li>Capturing only takes part when the trap is closed as result of the aggressors move - a pawn can by
                    itself move into the trap without being taken.
                </li>
                <li>The corner and center tiles always count as hostile for the purpose of closing a trap.</li>
